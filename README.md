# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to determine how similar or dissimilar the early success of Louise's play's fundraising is in comparison to other plays with similar goals and timelines, and determine from this how likely it is that she ultimately reaches her fundraising goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

From the graph of Outcomes based upon launch date, there is a very clear peak in terms of number of successful campaigns that are started during the summer, especially May. As the year goes on there is a precipitous decline in the amount of successful campaigns with the number of failed campaigns staying relatively the same as during the summer peak. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

From the graph of outcomes based on goals, there seems to be only one area in which the percentage of successful outcomes is distinctly higher than that of failures and it ranges between less than 1000 and 9999. After that it is pretty even in terms of success rate until a drastic decline in success rate once the goal hits 45000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One difficulty of the outcomes based on goals graph is the stark increase of canceled goals over the 45000 mark, which coincides with a decline in success rate. This could mean that the failure rate of these higher goal campaigns is much greater than it even seems but because the goals were canceled there is no way to truly determine how many of them would have failed or been successful.

## Results

The outcomes versus goals graph allows us to conclude that it is much more advantageous to begin a campaign over the summer as compared to any other season of year. Additionally, May is the best month of all to begin a campaign with a higher number of successful campaigns than any other signular month. Thus, Louise should start her campaign during the summer, and preferably during May, if she wants to have a better chance at succeeding. Additionally, the graph of outcomes based on goals allows us to conclude that if Louise wants to increase the probability of her campaign being funded, the goal should be under 10000, as there is a starkly higher success rate under that number. The cancelation of some goals does provide a drawback, especially to the outcomes based on goals with the higher goals.
